        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Hello there!</b> 👋<br>

            I go by the name of <b>Lanzoor</b>, but you can also call me <b>Lanzy</b>! My Japanese name is
            <ruby>
                光星
                <rp>(</rp><rt>こうせい</rt>
            </ruby>
            <ruby>
                蘭蒼瑠
                <rt>らんそうる</rt><rp>)</rp>
            </ruby> but you can still call me ランジョア.<br>
            My pronouns are <b>he/him</b>, and I live in <b>South Korea</b> 🇰🇷! (UTC+9, it is <code id="time_text">HH:MM:SS</code> here!)<br>
            I joined Discord on <b>October 7th, 2023</b>, and I am usually active on Discord most of the time. My birthday is <b>November 2nd</b> 🎂<br>
            My MBTI is <span class="tooltip"><b>INTP</b><span class="tooltip-text">
        I - Introverted<br>
        N - Overthinks<br>
        T - Thinks before empathizing<br>
        P - Prefers the flow
    </span>
</span>! (hover for more information) However, due to some personal reasons, life decided to hate on me, and I have developed ADHD, OCD and social anxiety.<br>
            I enjoy doing lots of things, but I am just going to name a few:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                🌐 <b>Studying languages, linguistics, and making conlangs</b><br>
                I want to study and experience lots of languages both for my conlangs and for fun.<br>
                I can speak Korean and English pretty fluently, and can speak some Japanese and Chinese.<br>
                I'm also currently studying Dutch, and interested in studying Greek and German.
            </li>
            <li>
                💻 <b>Making random programs and learning programming languages</b><br>
                I usually work on Linux, but I do not want to force myself into lots of intense programming work. I usually just make documents (like this!) or make small utility programs.<br>
                I am usually expected to write code in Python, because it suits the best for me. I am trying game development via <code>pygame</code> nowadays, but I also make interactive CLIs with Python.<br>
                I am also able to write some code in JavaScript and TypeScript. I started programming by learning JavaScript, so I know lots of things about JavaScript, but I still suck at actual web development.<br>
                (...and there's the markup languages. I can write HTML, CSS, Markdown, and some LaTeX. But only if you consider them actual programming languages.)<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                🔬 <b>Studying science and its various sub-branches</b><br>
                I like most sub-branches of science, and especially <b>🧪 chemistry, 🔭 astronomy, and ⚛️ physics.</b><br>
                I especially love astronomy, because I had interest in it ever since I was young.<br>
                Studying science isn't in my top priorities anymore, but when someone brings up the topic, I am still going to like it.
            </li>
            <li>
                🎮 <b>Playing games</b><br>
                I especially like <b>idle/clicker/incremental games, rhythm games, puzzle games, space simulation games, and platformer games.</b><br>
                I don't really like <b>horror games, adventure games, resource-management heavy games and RPG games</b>, though.<br>
                I play games everytime I feel like it, or I am stressed out because of everything.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                🎧 <b>Listening to music, and playing instruments.</b><br>
                I really, <i>really</i> like Japanese music. I mostly enjoy PJSK songs and vocaloid songs, but I sometimes listen to general J-Pop.<br>
                I also listen to some electronic music but only occasionally. I always put music on when programming or working on anything.<br>
                I like discovering random music, and occasionally looking back at Geometry Dash music. (brings me a lot of nostalgia)<br>
                I can also play the drum, but I'm not really that good at it.
            </li>
            <li>
                I also have some other small interests, such as solving Rubik's cubes, and drawing anime. But I'd really like to try out other things as well!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            That said, if you have any suggestions for any of my conlangs or my works, feel free to <a href="#connections">contact me </a> and ask me about your inquiry!<br><br>
            Thanks for reading this to the end! I will add more stuff about myself later on, so please check here frequently, but only if you'd like :3
