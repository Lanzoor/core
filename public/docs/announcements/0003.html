    <h1>Vacation Announcement</h1>

    <h2>January 29th</h2>

    <p>
        Starting from this Friday (January 30th, local time) to next Wednesday (February 4th), <b>I am going to be on a trip to 🇯🇵 &Omacr;saka, Japan!</b><br>
        I can't share furthermore details about the vacation due to privacy, but I will still be sending some pictures to close friends.<br>
        I will be a bit less active on Discord, and I won't be able to program during the vacation. (unless I find out a way on how to bring my ENTIRE desktop to Japan with me HAHA)<br>
        However, I will still be able to respond to anything on Discord, <b>so don't hesitate to message me meanwhile!</b> I'll make sure to post any necessary updates while I'm on the vacation.<br>
        <b>Thanks as always, and have a nice day! 👋</b>
    </p>
